# Twitter Spaces

### If you plan to hold your event in Twitter Spaces, everything else is basically the same but here's what's different:



**/poap start**

* Run this command, input Event name, duration, and choose Twitter Spaces as platform. DEGEN will then give you a link to ask for authorization to monitor the call. Here's what you will see:

![UPON CLICKING THIS, YOU'LL BE REDIRECTED TO TWITTER](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-02-16 20-29-46.png>)

* Once your Twitter account has been verified, you will see this prompt:

![YOU MAY CLOSE JUST CLOSE THIS TAB](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-02-16 20-33-49.png>)

Now that DEGEN is authorized to monitor your call, head over to your Twitter app and let's start running Twitter Spaces. To call DEGEN to monitor the call, let's run **/poap start** one more time with your Event name, duration, and Twitter Spaces as platform.



**Here's what you will see as a sign of confirmation:**

![SEND THE PROVIDED LINK FOR PARTICIPANTS TO RETWEET](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-02-16 20-37-51.png>)

You will then be sent a link to distribute to your participants. This will allow them claim their POAPs by the end of the event.

{% hint style="success" %}
Let your participants know that clicking on the link provided ables them to retweet and provide consent in receiving a DM from DEGEN to distribute their claim links via Twitter DM.
{% endhint %}

**/poap end**

* Run this command to stop DEGEN from monitoring your event. Here you will be given the csv file of your Twitter participants (make sure to save them), and will be asked for the links.txt file from /poap mint (make sure you have them in hand). Here's what you'll expect to see upon submission of links.txt file:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2022-02-16 20-46-05.png>)

**Participants should then receive a DM from DEGEN via Twitter DMs instantly!**
